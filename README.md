# ScQuickLaunch
Start StarCraft Faster!

http://www.staredit.net/topic/16489/

Arguments:
-ke (killExplorer) kills windows explorer and restarts it when starcraft's closed
-de (ddemulate) runs StarCraft with the ddemulate command (not compatible with wmode or custom start)
-fm (fastMenus) makes menus go by faster (credit to bwapi for addresses)
-zt (zeroTimer) automatically zeros the countdown timer in game lobbies (DO NOT USE ON MULTIPLAYER)
-nl (noLat) continuously forces the LAN latency level (THIS IS CHEATING IN MULTIPLAYER (though only a great antihack program will notice))
-w (windowed) attempts to auto-run wmode via chaoslauncher
-cs (customStart) runs the batch code found in CustomStarter.bat to start starcraft (so you can run something like scloader2b)
-ps (postLoad) runs the batch code found in PostLoad.bat to do stuff right after the starcraft window opens up (load antihacks perhaps)
-rm (runMap) (NOT YET COMPLETE) runs the map given as the next argument, for later integration with Chkdraft
